# create-inks2d

## Scaffolding Your First inks2d Project

With NPM:

```bash
$ npm create inks2d@latest
```

With Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn create inks2d
```

With PNPM:

```bash
$ pnpm create inks2d
```

Then follow the prompts!

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line options. For example, to scaffold a inks2d + Web project, run:

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create inks2d@latest my-inks2d-game --template web

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create inks2d@latest my-inks2d-game -- --template web

# yarn
yarn create inks2d my-inks2d-game --template web

# pnpm
pnpm create inks2d my-inks2d-game --template web
```

Currently supported platform presets include:

- `web`

You can use `.` for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.
